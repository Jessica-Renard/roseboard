          <h1>Is that a ...Hybrid <span class="tea"> Tea Rose?</span></h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          Hybrid Tea roses became popular with the cultivation of 'Soleil d'Or'
          by Pernet-Ducher in Lyons, France. This was at the very beginning of
          the 20th century: 1900. The 'Peace' rose (aka 'Madame A. Meilland'), was
          introduced by Francis Meilland at the end of World War II and is
          arguably the cultivar that made Hybrid Teas a most popular selection
          for the 20th century. Take a delve of other popular Hybrid Tea cultivars
          <a href="#Meilland" class="noline">below</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first Hybrid Tea rose world-over is arguably cited as 'La France' from
          1867, when French nurseryman Jean-Baptiste Andr√© Guillot hybridized a
          tea rose, most supposedly 'Madame Bravy', with a Hybrid Perpetual,
          most supposedly 'Madame Victor Verdier.' Hence, 'La France' was the
          very first of the Hybrid Tea term. 'Lady Mary Fitzwilliam' (of Henry
          Bennett in 1883), 'Souvenir of Wootton' (of John Cook in 1888) and
          'Madame Caroline Testout' (of Pernet-Ducher in 1890) are fellow
          cultivars soon to follow in that time period. Notice each featured in the left and top right sidebars. Scroll over and they'll give a nice curtsy or twirl.
        </p>
        <p>
          The appeals of combining tea rose qualities with perpetuals is no new
          fascination. Hybrid Perpetuals remained hardier, with Hybrid Tea roses
          often hardy to -25 degrees celsius. However, little information is
          available as to the hardiness of Hybrid Perpetuals in gardening
          vocation. Hybrid Perpetuals themselves were results of the desire to
          advance bloom remontancy, the term for repeating (incidence of)
          flowering in a season versus a single seasonal bloom of wild
          roses. Tea roses were named for their fragrance reminiscent of tea
          traditions, more potent given 'ever-blooming' status. Hybrid roses
          gain some of this pleasantry and greater repeat-flowering, but with
          stronger necks plus their typified long straight stems to uphold
          a fuller flora and make for extra nice cuttings. Thanks to

          You may already know several of these from highly retailed cut flowers. Roses are a favorite flower for many Americans, and the Saint Valentine's Day celebration of love and affection brings added attention to the category each year, particularly its Reds. Hybrid Teas have thrived as cuttings, and this has not lessened their popularity for home-grown options. In addition to Meilland's 'Peace', detailed above (and especially pegged for cool summer climates) 'Mr. Lincoln' and 'Veteran's Honor' are each lushly saturated Reds with standout fragrance.
