        <h1>Is that a ...Hybrid <span class='tea'> Tea Rose?</span></h1>
      </header>
      <p>Hybrid tea roses became popular with the cultivation of 'Soleil d'Or' by Pernet-Ducher in Lyons, France. This was at the very beginning of the 20th century: 1900. The Peace rose (aka 'Madame A. Meilland'), was introduced by Francis Meilland at the end of World War II and is arguably the cultivar that made hybrid teas a most popular selection for the 20th century. Take a delve through some horticultural highlights from six generations of Meilland cultivars <a href='#Meilland' class='noline'>below</a>.</p>
      <p>
        The first hybrid tea rose world-over is cited as 'La France' from 1867, when French nurseryman Jean-Baptiste Andr√© Guillot hybridized a tea rose, most supposedly 'Madame Bravy', with a hybrid perpetual, most supposedly 'Madame Victor Verdier.' Hence, 'La France' was the very first of the hybrid tea term. 'Lady Mary Fitzwilliam' (of Henry Bennett in 1883), 'Souvenir of Wootton' (of John Cook in 1888) and 'Madame Caroline Testout' (of Pernet-Ducher in 1890) are fellow cultivars soon to follow in that time period. </p>
      <p>
        The appeals of combining tea rose qualities with perpetuals is no new fascination. Hybrid perpetuals remained hardier, with hybrid tea roses often hardy to -25 degrees celsius. However, little information is available as to the hardiness of hybrid perpetuals in gardening vocation. Hybrid perpetuals themselves were results of the desire to further bloom remontancy, the term for repeating (incidence of) flowering in a season rather than the single seasonal bloom of wild roses. Tea roses were named for their fragrance reminiscent of tea traditions, more potent given 'ever-blooming' status. Hybrid roses gain some of this pleasantry and greater repeat-flowering, but with stronger necks added to their typified long, straight stems to uphold the fuller flora and make for extra nice cuttings. Thanks to <a class='noline' href= 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_tea_rose' target="_blank">Wikipedia's Hybrid Tea Rose</a> page for some of this featured information, available there.</p>
